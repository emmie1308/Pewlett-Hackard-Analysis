# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create two tables: one to determine the number of retiring employees and their position titles, and the other to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Within the first table, we included information such as employee number, first and last name, position title, and start and end date. In the second, we added employee number, first and last name, birth date, start and end date, and position title. 

## Results

The newly created tables show four key take-aways:
1.) amout 1/3 of the retirees are senior engineers, while another third includes the rest of the senior staff.
2.) Senior engineer and senior staff positions have the greatest priority, when it comes to deciding which roles the company needs to fill.
3.) Among those that are retiring, there are 1,549 employees that qualify for the mentorship program.
4.) There are more people retiring than there are potential mentors.

## Summary
To determine how many roles will need to be filled, we can categorize the retirees into age groups. For each year, the company can hire the amount of people that would be retiring, assuming that the retirement age is 65. Currently, we have a list of people who were born between 1952 and 1955. Therefore, we would have a different hiring quota for each of the following four years.
